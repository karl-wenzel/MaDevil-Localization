They're lead by the Highest Priestess, whose orders they obey without question. Men are forbidden to enter and intruders will be executed. The temple can easily be seen from afar due to it's bright white color. The inside is divided into multiple floors, symbolizing the different stages of wisdom the novices and priestesses aquire. Hence the name: '''Rising Temple'''.\n\nIf the novices pass certain exams, they're allowed to ignite fire bowls, granting them fs to higher floors.

The right eye on the upper right corner opens the quickbar and the left eye shows your current objective.\n\n5. The quickbar shows all your items by default, you can change what is displayed in your inventory.\n\n6. Under the eyes you can see your satiebar (brown), healthbar (red) and your staminabar (blue). You need stamina to run, perform dodge rolls and melee combat, but you guessed that already didn't you? Satiety is needed to regenerate your health during combat. So eat up, it might save your life. And lifepoints, well guess what you need them for...\n\n7. In the lower left corner you can find a button that opens the inventory.\n\n8. In your inventory you can select which items are shown in the quickbar. For example, in the window that opens when clicking on an item, you can put a mark at the 'show in quickbar' option, either each item or use the gear to change settings for itemgroups.\n\n9. Collecting items in the earlier levels will make you stronger later on.\n\n10. Dont be shy to eat food while fighting.\n\n11. Search for pyramid shaped skillpoints and use shrines of the Sea Goddess to pray and use skillpoints to acquire new skills and stats.\\n\\n12. Skills are powerful unique abilities, you can have 3 active at a time. Stats are small improvements to your attributes, like damage or movement speed. Stats are active permanently, even if you don't have the corresponding skill set as active.\n\n13. You can save at all times while in the menu, with the exception being while youre in a battle.
